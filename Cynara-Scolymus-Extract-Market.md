The use of natural additives aligns with the growing demand for healthier and cleaner poultry products, particularly in the wake of rising health-conscious consumer behavior. Furthermore, technological advancements in eubiotic formulation and the increasing collaboration between feed producers and eubiotic solution providers are expected to drive innovation in this market.
