This growth is largely attributed to several key factors such as the increasing popularity of DIY beauty routines, the introduction of innovative and specialized eyelash brushes, and the expansion of beauty product portfolios by leading cosmetics companies. The product's versatility, with different shapes and bristles designed for various lash types, is also fueling its demand. Consumers are increasingly aware of the benefits that these brushes provide, including more precise application, better lash separation, and the ability to enhance the volume and length of lashes without clumping. Additionally, the rise of social media influencers and beauty tutorials is driving more people to invest in quality eyelash tools to achieve professional-grade results at home.
